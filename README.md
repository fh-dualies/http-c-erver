## Configuration

### Configure http server

The http server can be configured by changing the values in the `main.h` file. These are only general configurations. 
For more specific configurations, the server itself must be modified (look for constants in `*.h` files).

## Run Project

The http server will process the request information and send a response back to the client.

```sh
$ ./build/server.out
```

## How to test

### Run unit tests

```sh
$ ./build/tests.out
```

### Run http tests

Note that [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is required to run the tests.

```sh
$ pyhton3 tests/http/tests.py
```

### Test output

Red: Assertion failed  
Green: Assertion passed
